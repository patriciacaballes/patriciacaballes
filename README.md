### Hey, it's me Patricia ! 👋

## Who Am I? 😁
I'm a curious and creative soul, always on the lookout for new challenges and opportunities to learn. I'm currently 👩‍🎓 studying web design at Mohole in Milan, where I'm honing my skills in creating beautiful and intuitive user experiences.

## What Makes Me Tick? 👩‍💻🤾‍♂️
When I'm not busy coding, you can find me spiking a 🏐 volleyball, tinkering with 📏 DIY projects, or 🌍 🛫 planning my next adventure . I'm a firm believer in the power of hands-on learning, and I love to dive deep into new skills and technologies to see what makes them tick.

## What Do I Do? 💻
As a web developer, I specialize in crafting clean, responsive, and user-friendly websites that showcase my clients' brands and messages. From design to development, I'm passionate about every step of the process, and I'm always looking for new and exciting ways to push the boundaries of what's possible.
